This repository is my way of training my coding skills, i'm using leetCode as a plataform to submit my answers, and study for job applications, or when i want to just relax and code a bit





### Results

Answers for many leetcode challenges, feel free to use whatever you liked it, they will probably be in C# files, since is my favorite language, but eventually i will try another
languages as well.
